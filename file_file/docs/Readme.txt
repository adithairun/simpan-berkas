How to install PHP Advanced Transfer Manager
--------------------------------------------

	 -  Create folder for php script on the server.
	 -  Customize, values of variables in file include/conf.php
	    See comments in file.
	 -  Customize files nn.php (where nn - is language code).
	 -  If your server require a particular extension to recognize php scripts
	    (eg '.php4') you have to set correctly the $phpExt in conf.php and
	    change the extension of all files EXCLUDING conf.php
	 -  Copy all files and subfolders to the server.
	 -  Chmod 777 all files and directories copied (this is very important)
	 -  Register your own new administrator account.
	 -  Activate your new account (needed, if request activation is "on")
	 -  Log in as user "Admin", password "test".
	 -  Go to the administrator console and set to the new account an
	    administrator rights.
	 -  Log in using new account, go to the administrator console and delete
	    "Admin" account. DO NOT FORGET DO THIS!!! This can be a serious
	    security hole!
	 -  As administrator customize header, footer and infos html-files.
	 -  Be sure, that user accounts is not visible, when you typing in browser
	    the address www.myserver.com/upload/users/username (where
	    www.myserver.com - is the server name where you installed your script,
	    username - the name of any registered user)
	    If visible, you have to configure server!


How to configure PHP Advanced Transfer Manager
----------------------------------------------

	 1. You can add your custom page header (i.e. banner at the top or at
	    the bottom of page, or site menu & copyrights) by changing files
	    header.htm & footer.htm, which placed in cfg folder.
	 2. You can change info, modifying file info.htm, which placed in
	    cfg folder. If you wish place different info's for different
	    languages you can assign different .htm filenames in language
	    files ($infopage variable).
	 3. You can change header of digest letter by editing mailinfo.htm file.
	 4. You can easy edit all above files using configuration panel.
	 5. If you wish change default folder where files will be stored, you can
	    edit variable $uploads_folder_name in file conf.php.
	    You have to set the relative path without trailing slash
	    (e.g. $uploads_folder_name = "files/uploads";)
	 6. Highly recommended change default user folder by changing
	    $users_folder_name variable. This improve your security.


How to create a new translation
-------------------------------

	 1. Translate an existing language file (stored in 'languages' folder)
	    and save it with name 'NN.php', where NN is the country code.
	 2. Create a new text file called 'NN.lang'.
	    - in the first line of this file insert the country code (NN)
	    - in the second the language name followed by timezone description (es. GMT, CET, GMT +1)
	    - in the third line insert the timezone offset from GMT without the plus
	      character if positive and with the minus character if negative.
	    Note: the timezone is calculated GMT + offset. The value on the second line
	    is only a description and it's not used to calculate the timezone.
	 2. Copy 'NN.php' and 'NN.lang' to the 'languages' directory on the server
	 3. Chmod 755 these two new files.
	 4. Please, don't forget send us your translation. We include it in the new

	3. Insert here all the code you need to display the file: you have three global
	   variables set containing filename, relative path and absoulte path. Use them
	   to show the file.
